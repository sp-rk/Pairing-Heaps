# Pairing-Heaps
A pairing heap is a type of heap data structure with relatively simple implementation and excellent practical amortized performance.\
Our designed pairing heap has a total of 5 functions.
#### 1) Insert:
      creates a node of the value passed as argument and adds it to the heap.
#### 2) Merge:
      Merges the input heap with the current heap and returns the final Root Node.
#### 3) FindMinimum:
      Return the Root Node value.
#### 4) ExtractMinimum:
      Deletes the root node, merges its siblings by 2-pass method forming a new heap and then returns the value of deleted node.
#### 5) Print:
      Prints Each and every link between all the nodes of the heap.
